## Personal summary
> Since the late ‘90 I have been working with back-end technologies. My background is coming from PHP and Drupal. I am also made extensive progress with application and agile development. This naturally led my interest to DevOps and Cloud. For over last 5 years, I was shifting to this role, finishing my last job working mostly on preparing CI/CD pipelines, scripting and monitoring, significantly decreasing overall deployment time, helping developers with their everyday work and cutting customer complaints. I have made my first <a href="https://bit.ly/aws-cert" target="\_blank">Cloud certificate</a> almost two years ago. I am anticipate to develop aforesaid interests in upcoming years.

> I am looking forward to work with an innovative company or a start-up. In the near future, I envision myself working with people who are developing ground-breaking technology which potentially will have an impact on renewable energy, food production, NGO, education or related areas. I am also opened for any suggestions but ideally, they should revolve around similar topics.
